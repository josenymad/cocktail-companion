Your online guide for making cocktails, built collaboratively by Jose Wills, [Camilla Priest-Stephens](https://github.com/cprieststephens), and [Matt Mullins](https://github.com/mullinsmmm).

The initial idea for this project was conceptualised by [Max Tauroza](https://github.com/max-tau)  

We designed the site using Figma, used Trello for planning and general project organisation, and Slack for communication.
 
We managed our project using the scrum agile methodology to deliver the MVP before our deadline, and prioritised our tasks using the MosCoW method.

Our tests were written using Jest and React Testing Library.

The data is fetched from [the cocktail database API](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php)
